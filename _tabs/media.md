### Aussie accents to be preserved for posterity (26 January 2011)

Our accent is a powerful and enduring symbol of national identity that
we preserve despite the influx of electronic media and cultural icons
from overseas. However, just as society changes, so too does accent as
it constantly evolves to meet the changing needs of its users.

A national initiative to collect the accents of 1000 Australian English
speakers is being launched today, Australia Day. Australian English
accents from adults of all ages from various locations in all states and
territories will be collected to represent the regional and social
diversity of Australian English.
