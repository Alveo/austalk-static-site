Annotations for the Austalk data are available via the
[Alveo Contributions](https://app.alveo.edu.au/contrib/) facility.
This allows third parties to upload annotations and other files
associated with the original data in Austalk.   Annotation
files will also appear alongside the original data in Alveo.

In addition you can download the [Austalk Annotation
Report]({% link assets/attachments/Austalk-Annotation-Report.pdf %}) that
describes the annotation that has been completed and the standards that
were used for transcription etc.
