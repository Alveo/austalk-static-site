title: AusTalk - An audio-visual corpus of Australian English
layout: page
---

AusTalk is a large state-of-the-art database of modern spoken Australian
English from all around the country. Recorded between June 2011 and June
2016, the final database contains full audio-visual data for 861 adult
speakers (with age ranging from 18 to 83) from 15 different locations in
all Australian states & territories, representing the regional and
social diversity and linguistic variation of Australian English,
including Australian Aboriginal English. Each speaker was recorded for
one hour on three separate occasions to sample their voice in a range of
scripted and spontaneous speech situations at various times (see
[About AusTalk](/about/) for a more detailed description of
the data collection protocol). Later, this database will be expanded to
include more age groups, including children, more accents and more ways
of speaking.

The Australian accent is distinctive and uniquely ours. The things we
talk about and the ways we talk about them are intimately entwined with
our sense of self. Our accent is a powerful and enduring symbol of
national identity that we preserve despite the influx of electronic
media and cultural icons from overseas. However, just as society
changes, so too does language as it constantly evolves to meet the
changing needs of its users. Australian English has seen much change
throughout its history and its in the national interest to carefully
document our linguistic heritage as an important record of our
collective identity within our changing culture.

AusTalk provides a valuable and enduring digital repository of present
day speech as a snapshot of present day speech in our linguistic
history. As there is a close link between \"national self-perception\"
and how we use language AusTalk will be a **profound cultural resource**
for all Australians.

## For Researchers

To access the AusTalk corpus please go to the
[Alveo Virtual Laboratory](http://alveo.edu.au/) and register 
for an account. See [these notes](https://alveo.edu.au/2015/10/14/accessing-austalk-in-alveo/)
about how to access AusTalk data. A customised interface for AusTalk
(AusTalk-Query) will allow you to browse preview and download the audio
recordings in the corpus.

Some of the AusTalk data has been transcribed and annotated both
manually and automatically. See [this page](/annotations/) for more
information.

The AusTalk database is one step in a major research project spanning
two decades. For the Australian community AusTalk is a national treasure
that will provide a permanent record of Australian English. It will also
support Australian speech science research and development and help
develop Australian speech technology applications from better
telephone-based speech recognition systems (e.g. taxi bookings) and
computer avatars to hearing aids and Cochlear Implants improvements or
computer aids for learning-impaired children. See
